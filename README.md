# CS50 - Problem Sets and Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and final project from Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science.  It covers topics such as C, Python, algorithms, data structures, SQL, web development, and more.

## Structure
- **Week 0 – Scratch**  
  Visual programming with Scratch, focusing on logic and problem-solving.
- **Week 1 – C**  
  Introduction to the C language, variables, conditionals, loops, and basic programs.
- **Week 2 – Arrays**  
  Working with arrays, strings, cryptography, and Caesar/Vigenère ciphers.
- **Week 3 – Algorithms**  
  Sorting and searching algorithms, algorithmic complexity (Big O).
- **Week 4 – Memory**  
  Pointers, memory allocation, files, and data representation.
- **Week 5 – Data Structures**  
  Linked lists, hash tables, tries, and dynamic data structures.
- **Week 6 – Python**  
  Introduction to Python, syntax, libraries, and problem-solving.
- **Week 7 – SQL**  
  Databases, SQL queries, relationships, and data analysis.
- **Week 8 – Web**  
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and web programming basics.
- **Week 9 – Flask**  
  Deeper dive into Flask, sessions, authentication, and final web projects.
- **Final Project**  
  My final project for CS50, applying concepts learned throughout the course.
